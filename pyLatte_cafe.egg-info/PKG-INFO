        pyLatte
        ========
        
        pyLatte is a diagnostics/verification package for climate forecast systems. It is still in the very early stages of development.
        
        Current functionality
        ======================
        
        Three modules are currently available
        
        1. ``skill`` : functions for assessing one data set relative to another (usually model output relative to observation).
        
        2. ``utils`` : general support functions for the pyLatte package. 
        
        3. ``indices`` : functions for computing various indices in the ocean and atmosphere.
        
        Some test modules are also avaliable in ``pylatte.test``. However, these are far from complete 
        
        Usage (CSIRO OA\_DCFP users only)
        ==================================
        
        1. Install anaconda if you have not already done so:
        
        * Make your own directory in '/OSM/CBR/OA\_DCFP/apps/'
        
        ``mkdir /OSM/CBR/OA_DCFP/apps/<userid>``
        
        * A recent version of the anaconda installer is available in '/OSM/CBR/OA\_DCFP/apps/anaconda\_installer'. Run this and follow the prompts to install anaconda in the directory you have just created.
        
        * The anaconda installer will add the anaconda path to your .bashrc (or equivalent). You will need to source this for the changes to be made:
        
        ``source ~/.bashrc``
        
        * Check that anaconda python is now your default:
        
        ``which python``
        
        2. Install pylatte:
        
        * Clone the pyLatte Bitbucket repository to your local machine. At your desired location, run:
        
        ``git clone https://<userid>@bitbucket.csiro.au/scm/df/pylatte.git``
        
        * Replicate the pyLatte environment locally. This will ensure that you have all libraries/packages required to run pyLatte. Within the 'requirements' folder in your cloned repository, run:  
          
        ``conda env create -f pylatte_env_linux.yml``  
          
        or  
          
        ``conda env create -f pylatte_env_mac.yml``  
          
        depending on your os.  
          
        Alternatively, if updating an existing pylatte\_env environment, run:  
        
        ``conda env update --file=pylatte_env_<os>.yml``
        
        * Activate the pylatte\_env environment:
        
        ``source activate pylatte_env``
        
        * Install the pyLatte package. Within your cloned repository, run:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
